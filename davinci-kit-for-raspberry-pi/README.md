## Trouble Shootings:
You’ll need a new wiringPi for the Raspberry Pi 4B.
To upgrade:
```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://project-downloads.drogon.net/wiringpi-latest.deb
sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb
```
Check with:
```bash
gpio -v
```
and make sure it’s version 2.52. 

It will hopefully be part of the official release soon, but not for now.
